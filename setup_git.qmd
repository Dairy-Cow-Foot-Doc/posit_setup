# Check Access to Posit Academy Campsite

-   [Posit Course Campsite](https://app.posit.academy/dashboard)

This website will have the weekly activities for the course. For the
milestones we will use a repository on GitHub that is dairy specific.

# Install R and R Studio

Links for Windows computers

1.  Download
    [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-4.5.1-win.exe) and
    [R
    Tools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/files/rtools45-6608-6492.exe)

2.  Download [R
    Studio](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2025.09.1-401.exe)

# Setting up Github

We will use Github to access and share materials in the course. GitHub
is a version control method that allows you to not have to rename files
to keep track of changes. It requires a few steps to set up but is worth
the effort as it will allow you to go back in time and undo mistakes.
