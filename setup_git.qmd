# Check Access to Posit Academy Campsite

-   [Posit Course Campsite](https://app.posit.academy/dashboard)

This website will have the weekly activities for the course. For the
milestones we will use a repository on GitHub that is dairy specific.

You will be able to start the first week on Monday Oct 22nd. You will
have 2 weeks to complete the first week and we won't discuss materials
in the first week until Oct 29th. After that you will have 1 week to
work on materials with a few breaks during the holidays.

# Install R and R Studio

Links for Windows computers

1.  Download
    [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-4.5.1-win.exe) and
    [R
    Tools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/files/rtools45-6608-6492.exe)

2.  Download [R
    Studio](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2025.09.1-401.exe)

3.  Change R Studio settings by going into Tools and Global options to
    reflect the images below

# Setting up Github

We will use Github to access and share materials in the course. GitHub
is a version control method that allows you to not have to rename files
to keep track of changes. It requires a few steps to set up but is worth
the effort as it will allow you to go back in time and undo mistakes.

## Set up a personal GitHub Account

-   [GitHub.com](https://github.com)

## Install Git for Windows

Required to make GitHub work. MACs typically have it installed

-   <https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.49.0.windows.1>

## Install Github Desktop

Usefull to have to solve certain problems

-   <https://github.com/apps/desktop>

    or

# Set up Git and GitHub in R Studio

1.  Open R Studio and install and load packages to set up git

    *Hover in top right corner of the code box below and you can copy
    the code without needing to highlight it.*

```{r}

if (!require("usethis")) install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
```

2.  Tell Git who you are

    -   enter your user.name and user.email information that you used to
        set up your GitHub account above

```{r}
use_git_config(user.name = "enter_your_user_name",
               user.email = "enter_your_email.com")
```

3.  Get PAT (Personal Access Token)

    -   Go to the bottom of the screen that show up and press generate

    -   Then copy the PAT

```{r}
usethis::create_github_token()
```

4.  register git using the PAT from Above

```{r}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

# Set up Slack

We will use Slack to communicate as a group. You will get an invite to
the email you used to register in the course. The benefit of Slack is
that we can use it to share code easily and ask questions if you are
stuck on a piece of code etc.

-   <https://slack.com/>
-   [workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T09M3BYDEKF/C09M0EBENN7?entry_point=workspaces)
    -   Introduce yourself so we can all get to know you before we meet
        Wed October 22nd

***Below is optional and will only work after Monday October 20th. We
will do this together get if you get stuck on our first meeting on
Wednesday or we can set up a time later in the week.***
